# About Me
Hi, I’m Kyle Noel De Guzman. I graduated in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, specializing in Information Systems from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

I’m currently working as a Technical Project Analyst at Toolup.com, where I help manage data-focused projects that keep things running smoothly and support smarter decision-making across the company. I really enjoy the process of solving problems, finding patterns in the data, and figuring out how to make things better.

Right now, I’m continuing to grow my skills in Excel, Python, SQL, and visualization tools like Power BI. I’m someone who’s always curious. I love learning new things and finding better ways to do the work. Whether it’s through personal projects or real-world challenges, I’m excited to keep building and improving as a data professional.
